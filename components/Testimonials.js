        "Working with Topher on my new site was a dream. He worked quickly, thoughtfully and was very responsive. I had a lot of questions on updating the site myself. He walked me through all of my concerns, polished out all the details and completed the site very quickly. I love the look of my new site! I would recommend Topher highly.",

        "Topher is a web design wizard. He was incredible to work with from start to finish and was able to build us a completely custom web site. He leverages several useful tools to facilitate the process and maintained great communication and transparency through the whole process. I highly recommend Stupendous Web if youâ€™re in the market for a professional website!",

        "I absolutely loved working with Topher. My website looks exactly how I wanted. Anytime something needed to be changed it was done in a prompt and timely manner. Topher seems to have endless possibilities as far as function and the overall design. It looks just like what I requested. I say if you know what you want, Topher can get it done with quality!",
