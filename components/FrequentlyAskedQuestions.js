      question: "What's the difference between a website and a web app?",
      answer: (
        <Text>
          Both are good for building community and getting the word out about
          how you can help your audiences do what they love. The main difference
          is capability; a website is more static and limited and a web app or
          even phone app can handle much more dynamic interaction. I start all
          projects as scalable web apps from the beginning because you and your
          business will continue to grow and have increasingly dynamic and
          interactive requirements.

      question: "Do you build mobile apps? Even Android?",
      answer: (
        <Text>
          Yes, I build both iOS and Android apps! In fact, a mobile app is a
          powerful tool for keeping close to existing and even new audiences.
          Building a website, web app, and mobile app side by side is actually
          pretty common. It&apos;s a great idea to take advantage of a mobile
          version of your project early on in the process.

      question: "How much do your services cost?",
      answer: (
        <Text>
          That depends on the scope of the project. I charge a flat hourly rate
          and no extra fees, therefore I take into consideration how many hours
          it will take to complete your goals by assessing past projects when
          creating you a project outline and quote. There is no deposit
          necessary and you will be charged every two weeks during development
          via an invoice to your email that you can pay online. I also offer
          monthly long term support to keep your project online and running
          smoothly for a monthly fee after your project is complete. First we
          need to meet! I want to understand who you are and what you&apos;re
          working on. Then, we&apos;ll discuss what you need and I can provide a
          more accurate estimate of the cost of your project. Schedule your free
          consultation to learn more about my pricing.

      question: "How long do I have to wait for my website or software?",
      answer: (
        <Text>
          I can deliver a website or app in just a few weeks, sometimes sooner.
          Obviously it may take longer for more demanding projects and we have
          to account for being thorough. Being thorough means saving time and
          expenses on reworking issues as well as creating you a more valuable
          product.

          have a knack for both, but I have a degree in web application
          development from Colorado State University as well as many years of
          experience.

      question: "What's your process?",

          First we meet and plan your project in your software consultation. We
          refine your product and stratagize ways to make your project
          successful. After you approve your project plan and quote, we&apos;ll
          begin designing and development. I build using unique, beautiful,
          organized, and accessible design principles and the latest development
          best practices. You&apos;ll receive a secret link to preview your
          project anytime. You can review, make comments, and submit requests
          anytime during the process. With your approval we&apos;ll launch your
          product. After your project is launched we&apos;ll discuss a long term
          support plan that fits your needs and keeps your application running
          smoothly!
