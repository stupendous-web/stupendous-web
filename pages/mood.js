                      Hello, pioneers. I&apos;m Topher. People say I&apos;m INFP
                      which means, though sometimes I&apos;m introverted,
                      I&apos;m also intuitive, feeling, and prospecting.
                      I&apos;m here to help elevate your projects that support
                      meaningful work, tolerance, equality, creativity, and
                      authenticity through my custom software development
                      services. My degree in web application development from
                      CSU, award-winning projects, and years of work experience
                      are all at your disposal.

                      Our values come up in everything we do. I value meaningful
                      work, tolerance, equality, creativity, and authenticity.
                      Purposeful software development services solve problems
                      for my clients and their communities through these things.
                      Building meaningful websites, web apps, and iOS and
                      Android apps helps my clients create a more diverse and
                      tolerant world through inventiveness.
