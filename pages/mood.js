              Hello, pioneers. I&apos;m Topher. People say I&apos;m INFP which
              means, though sometimes I&apos;m introverted, I&apos;m also
              intuitive, feeling, and prospecting. I&apos;m here to help elevate
              your projects that support meaningful work, tolerance, equality,
              creativity, and authenticity through my custom software
              development services. My degree in web application development
              from CSU, award-winning projects, and years of work experience are
              all at your disposal.

              their communities through these things. Building meaningful
