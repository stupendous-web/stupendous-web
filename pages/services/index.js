                    I enjoy offering these consultations at no charge because I
                    believe working closely together is how we build strong
                    communities. I offer two consultations alongside my software
                    development services. In the first, I&apos;ll get to know
                    you and the value your product is providing your
                    communities. In the second, we&apos;ll make a plan for
                    getting your product in the hands of those who need it most
                    via your web, iOS, and Android apps. These consultations are
                    designed for us to better deliver your product in a more
                    impactful way.

                    A website or even a web app is still a must-have. It is my
                    pleasure to build people with strong purpose in life
                    websites that help them meet their goals. That&apos;s why my
                    software development services include building you a website
                    or web app. A website is just the beginning, but the
                    internet is still a powerful community to share your work
                    in. Your website or web app will bring awareness and
                    authority to you, your business, and what you do.
