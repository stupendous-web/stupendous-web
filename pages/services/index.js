                I enjoy offering these consultations at no charge because I
                believe working closely together is how we build strong
                communities. I offer two consultations alongside my software
                development services. In the first, I&apos;ll get to know you
                and the value your product is providing your communities. In the
                second, we&apos;ll make a plan for getting your product in the
                hands of those who need it most via your web, iOS, and Android
                apps. These consultations are designed for us to better deliver
                your product in a more impactful way.
