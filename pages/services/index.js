                    I&apos;m focused on launching a project for you that excels
                    your brand. I&apos;m going to surround myself in your
                    product, build you top-of-the-line web, iOS, and Android
                    applications that reflect your product, give it a place on
                    the web and on everybody&apos;s phone, so your community can
                    find it and connect with you, and maintain the project even

                    I enjoy offering these consultations at no charge because I
                    believe working closely together is how we build strong
                    communities. I offer two consultations alongside my software
                    development services. In the first, I&apos;ll get to know
                    you and the value your product is providing your
                    communities. In the second, we&apos;ll make a plan for
                    getting your product in the hands of those who need it most
                    via your web, iOS, and Android apps. These consultations are
                    designed for us to better deliver your product in a more
                    impactful way.

                    A website or even a web app is still a must-have. It is my
                    pleasure to build people with strong purpose in life
                    websites that help them meet their goals. That&apos;s why my
                    software development services include building you a website
                    or web app. A website is just the beginning, but the
                    internet is still a powerful community to share your work
                    in. Your website or web app will bring awareness and
                    authority to you, your business, and what you do.

                    vital to what you do. Engage with your community, audiences,
                    and people who love and need your product the most with a
                    website and iOS/Android app.

                    Even well-working machines need their oil changed. Web, iOS,
                    and Android applications are just the same. They will need
                    upgrades and security updates from time to time. You may
                    even want to make minor changes occasionally. I&apos;ll keep
                    your application up-to-date with the latest technology and
                    safe against security breaches. I&apos;ll even make minor
                    updates as needed. Long term support will keep your
                    technology fresh, your data safe, and your brand unique and
                    desirable even after your software development services are
