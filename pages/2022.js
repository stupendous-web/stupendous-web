                At the end of every year I try my best with various tools and
                methods to assess who I am and my values to better serve myself,
                my communities, and my clients. Here are some conclusions I drew
                from 2022.

                I ask all my clients what their values are because I think it
                comes up in what all of us do. According to{" "}

                  authenticity

                . Building web apps makes me happy but when I build something
                meaningful to someone it gives me true happiness. Building
                meaningful websites helps my clients create a more diverse and
                tolerant world through inventiveness.

                I love working with and connecting with people who want to see
